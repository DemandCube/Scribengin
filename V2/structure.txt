    The data is stored in multiple *.dat file, we can provide method such compact or merge to optomize the data, 
    maybe need to have uuid in each dat file to allow concurrent write]

    When the stream write or append the data, a new buffer should be created with the writing extension.  
    When the writer commit, the buffer should be flush and rename to complete. A new buffer should be created e 
    and prepare for the next append. If the writer call rollback, the buffer should be deleted and recreate.
    The buffer 1, 2, ... n should be merged and create the next dat file in the second phase of commit.
